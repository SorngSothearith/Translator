# Translator JSON To Any Language 

Translator JSON To Any Language is using Nodejs for translate from one language to any language with google translator

## Getting started

Install node_module

```bash
# npm install
```

## Usage

```nodejs
1 - Copy your language file to input file only 1 file
2 - Run node index.js
3 - Select your current language key
4 - Choose what language you want to translate
5 - Choose n to not let node translate more languages 
6 - Let wait until node translate done
7 - Boom!! ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥  take a look in your output folder
```
## Recommend 
 I recommend you to run one by one language or use multiple Terminal to run node index.js so it will not take long
## Customize
```nodejs
1 - let availableLang = ["en", "km", "zh-CN", "fr", "th"]; check https://translate.google.com open inspect element or use ctrl + shift + c and select in select language your will see data-language-code copy it and past to array
2 - let exceptKeyLangs = [] add any string you want to skip translate
```
